## Module 1. Computer architecture
### Task 1 - Topic 1 Introduction to computer architecture
Develop an assembler program that calculates the result of the expression 'variable_b minus variable_c plus variable_a' and stores the outcome in a specified memory address.

### Task 2 - Topic 2 Introduction to compilers and interpreters
Enhance Lexer Functionality
Introduce additional token types to accommodate multiplication MUL, division DIV, and parentheses, encompassing both opening LPAREN and closing RPAREN components within arithmetic expressions. Revise the get_next_token method within the Lexer class to appropriately identify and handle these newly introduced characters.

Modify the Parser
Incorporate a factor method to manage both numbers and expressions enclosed within parentheses.
Adjust the term method to encompass multiplication and division operations.
Ensure that the expr method is appropriately updated to accommodate the revised hierarchy of operations.
Update the Interpreter
Expand the functionality of the visit_BinOp method within the Interpreter class to include handling of multiplication and division operations.

Testing
Verify the accuracy of the interpreter's calculations across a range of arithmetic expressions, including those involving parentheses. For example, ensure that (2 + 3) * 4 results in 20.
